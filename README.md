### Hey, I'm Anthony - a student transferring to University of Minnesota - Twin Cities for Computer Science.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  aboutMe();
}
```
I'm currently working on TamoStudy, which is an interactive Java application that implements a "Tamagotchi" and allows the user to focus on their work.
I play games, read, edit, and code!
